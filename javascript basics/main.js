//bind approach
//The bind() method returns a new function, when invoked, has its this sets to a specific value.
//Unlike the call() and apply() methods, the bind() method doesnâ€™t immediately execute the function. It just returns a copy of the function whose this sets to thisArg argument and which can be invoked later

//Polyfill is a fallback for a method that is not supported by the browser by default. You can find browser support for any function or method on the mdn website.
//polyfill for bind - it means creating own implementation of bind function
//everymethod should get access to mybind method like they get access to bind method, so use Function.prototype
